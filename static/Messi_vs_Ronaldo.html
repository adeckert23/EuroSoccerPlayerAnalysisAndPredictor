                              <p>The most heated debate in world football today, is who do you think is better.  Messi or Ronaldo?  There can only be one.  I've said multiple times, they are both great, and they bring different things to their respective teams.  Why can't we appreciate them both?  That opinion gets no respect, and often ridiculed, so I decided to look into their performances this year for their clubs. </p>
                              <blockquote>Ronaldo pushed for his transfer out of Madrid, and we can now see what he brought to that team, as they have had a sub-par year on all fronts.  People assumed Juventus bought Ronaldo was like buying Champions League success, and getting knocked out of the Champions League by Ajax this past week, was a referendum on the transfer, misses the point of how well he has played this season.  One thing we can say about Ronaldo, is that he has now proved himself in the three biggest leagues out there, while Messi has been coddled at Barcelona, and doesn't strive to succeed elsewhere, including for the big occasion for Argentina.</blockquote>
                              <p>When comparing him to Messi, you may think he is under-performing this year, but just look at his comparison compared to the other forwards in Serie A, and you can truly appreciate what he is doing, in what is considered a tougher defensive and more tactically astute league.</p>

                              <h3>Final Say</h3>
                              <p>I think we can say that Messi is a step above this year, and has clearly bounced back after what was considered a severly dissapointing World Cup for Argentina.  He leads all of the leagues with 32 goals this season, and his Assists, Dribbles/game and Key Passes/game are all at elite levels across the continent.  We can also point to the performance of Barcelona, and as they progress to the Champions League semi-final and Barcelona are well on their way to claiming La Liga with little suspense.</p>

                         <p> You can always count on the Italians for Drama.  Piatek is challenging Ronaldo and Fabio Quagliarella for most goals in Serie A at this point of the season.  If we had aggregated his stats for both Genoa and Milan the chart would reflect that, but you can tell by the rest of his per game stats, he doesn't stack up to the quality that Ronaldo has showed.  Still Piatek's impressive return of 13 goals in 19 games in his first season after his transfer from the Polish league, earned him a mid-season transfer to AC Milan.  Fabi "Wondergoal" Quagliarella, who at 36, is seeing quite a resurgance, and is the stand out attacking performer of the Italian league along with Ronaldo.  Meanwhile, Icardi of Inter, has been a mainstay atop the Italian goal-scoring charts for some time now, started the season well, and has since refused to play for Inter Milan, and we are expecting a transfer out at the end of the season.  O the Drama! </p>
